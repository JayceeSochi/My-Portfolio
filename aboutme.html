<h3>
    Hello, my name is Justin Volturo (I also go by <em>Jaycee</em>) and I am a First Year at Neumont College of Computer Science.<br>
    I play <strong>Counter-Strike</strong> and <strong>VALORANT</strong> collegiately for Neumont, though I usually play Minecraft.<br>
    I was born in Portland, Oregon, and plan on majoring in Computer Science due to my desire to broaden my skillsets.<br>
